        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            In this work, we aim to imitate the human ability to selectively attend to a single speaker,
            even in the presence of multiple simultaneous talkers. To achieve this, we propose a novel
            approach for TSE that leverages the listenerâ€™s HRTF to isolate the desired speaker. Notably,
            our method does not rely on speaker embeddings, making our solution speaker independent and
            enabling strong generalization across multiple speech datasets in different languages.
        </p>

        <p>
            We employ a fully complex-valued neural network that operates directly on the complex-valued
            STFT of the mixed audio signals. This stands in contrast to conventional approaches that use
            spectrograms or treat the real and imaginary components of the STFT as separate real-valued
            inputs.
        </p>

        <p>
            We began with the anechoic and noise-free setting, where the proposed method demonstrated
            superior extraction performance while successfully preserving the binaural cues of the desired
            signal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, we extended our approach to the reverberant setting, aiming to perform
            dereverberation alongside target speaker extraction. This resulted in a method that remains
            effective even in reverberant environments, maintaining the speech clarity and its sense of
            direction.
